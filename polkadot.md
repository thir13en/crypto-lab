# Polkadot

Polkadot is a blockchain technology inspired in Ethereum. In fact, it was founded by one of the Ethereum founders: Dr. Gavin Wood.  

Polkadot is a Sharded Blockhcain that can be considered a blockchain of blockchains: a blockchain composed of parachains.  
Sharded blockchains bring extreme value in terms of scalability, because of process parallelization. If one of the individual parachains is bloated, it won't affect the rest of the parachains.  
It is a good idea aparently since Ethereum is also moving to a sharded blockchain in Eth 2.0

### The Relay Chain
The heart of the Polkadot network: security and interoperability.

### Parachains
Blockhcains built on top of Polkadot with their own utility tokens.

### Bridges
These are the entities that will allow the parachains to communicate with external networks.
